# Notes
As a high school student entering college, I realized that I still hadn't developed my own style of taking notes during class. Over the summer, I built a web platform and desktop application to live sync my markdown notes (with LaTeX support) so that I could easily view my notes from anywhere. Check it out at [notes.sohampardeshi.me](notes.sohampardeshi.me)!
